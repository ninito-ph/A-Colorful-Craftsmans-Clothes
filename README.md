<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a small project I did for a coding interview over 4 days. It was requested that I also pay attention to game design and art elements for the project. Notably, the art is taken from premade packs (Though I did modify certain things here and there).

### Built With
Tank Wrecks and its assets were built using the following software:
* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
* [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Head over to the releases section and download the latest release! It includes the project's source code and a working build for windows.

### Minimum Requirements

You will need a working machine running:
* Windows 7 (SP1+) or later;
* DX11 or later capable graphics card;
* A x86 or x64 architecture cpu

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## How To Play

This information is also present in-game in a one-time tutorial popup. In any case, if you want to reference it, here it is;
- Walk around using WASD. Move towards a flower and press E to collect it.
- Press TAB to open your inventory. This will allow you to see your current items and ongoing clothing orders.
- After collecting a few flowers, go towards the building you spawned near - the Clothing Shop. Press E to enter it.
- To your right, next to the shopkeeper, there is the Dyeing station. Use the flowers (Which represent CMYK pigments) to select a clothing item and dye it. To complete an order, you must dye a similar clothing item to a similar color.
- Once you've dyed an item, talk to the Shopkeep by pressing E near him. If you've got a sufficiently similar clothing item, you'll be paid! Additionally, NPCs may wear the clothing item you sold!
- If you want to wear the clothes you make yourself, go to the Wardrobe just above the Shopkeep. Press E to interact with it, and wear any clothing item in your inventory!
